        "Fraud detection is an application of binary classification prediction. Fraud cases, which account for only a small fraction of the transaction universe, constitute a minority class that makes the dataset highly imbalanced. In general, the less balanced the dataset, the poorer the performance of the classification predictor would be.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to address this classical problem of fraud detection associated with the imbalanced dataset, we can use GANs as a data augmentation tool. In other words, GANs can generate realistic synthetic data of the minority fraud class and transform the imbalanced dataset perfectly balanced.\n",
